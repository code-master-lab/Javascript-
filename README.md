ðŸš€ My JavaScript Journey

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Repository!
This repo is my journal â€” capturing how I started, what I learned, and how far Iâ€™ve come in mastering JavaScript.

ðŸŒ± About This Repo

Here, youâ€™ll find my practice files, mini-projects, experiments, and notes â€” all arranged to reflect my progressive learning path from zero to a stronger foothold in JS.

ðŸ“º My Learning Source

My main guide throughout this journey has been the JavaScript Full Course (2024-25) â€“ Beginners to Pro playlist on YouTube.

This series took me step-by-step through the fundamentals and beyond, helping me build strong foundations in JavaScript.

ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Find Inside

Code snippets / practice files organized by topic

Mini-projects that reinforced what I learned

Notes, experiments, and debugging attempts

A clear path from basics â†’ intermediate JS

ðŸ“š Covered Topics

Some of the key areas Iâ€™ve worked through:

Variables, data types & operators

Conditionals & loops

Functions (regular & arrow)

Arrays & objects

DOM manipulation & event handling

ES6+ features (spread, destructuring, etc.)

Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await, Fetch API)

ðŸ’¬ My Reflections

Starting from scratch was intimidating, but each small successâ€”writing my first function, manipulating the DOM, fetching dataâ€”fueled my motivation.
This journey isnâ€™t over yet â€” thereâ€™s always more to learn and build.
